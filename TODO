New features:
- add an option for players to set delay between opening tabs (at least 250 ms)
- add an option for players to set min

Found bugs::
- Attacks in the night bonus (probably fixed)
- Wrong amount of catapults (probably fixed)
- getCounts and usedPlayerVillage didnt work as intended because Javascript doesnt like saving object as keys in dictionaries (probably fixed by using maps)
